Building with make (Linux):
> cd src
> make

This will build, install to a local 'install' directory, and
run regression tests.

Contents of install directory:
install/bin:
ptxinfo

install/include:
PtexHalf.h  PtexInt.h  Ptexture.h  PtexUtils.h

install/lib:
libPtex.a  libPtex.so



Building with cmake:
mkdir build
cd build
cmake -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=../install ../src
make
make test
make install
make doc

Note: docs will be generated in the 'build/doc' directory
and installed as 'install/share/doc/ptex'.
