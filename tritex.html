<h1><a class="anchor" name="tritex">Triangle textures</a></h1>
Triangular textures in Ptex are stored as power-of-two images with triangular texels.<p>

For ease of storage and access, the texels are divided into even and
odd texels and the odd texels are unfolded to form a rectangular image
as shown below. The main differences between the triangle and quad
textures are:<ul>

<li>The resolutions must be symmetric powers of two. I.e. the images must be square.</li>
<li>The adjacency data is identical to the quad case, but the adjacent face and edge values for the fourth edge of each face are ignored.</li>
<li>Subfaces are not supported. (Non-quad faces in a quad mesh can be mapped with quad subfaces, but this is unnecessary with a triangle mesh.)</li></ul>
