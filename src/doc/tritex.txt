\page tritex Triangle textures

Triangular textures in Ptex are stored as power-of-two images with triangular texels.

For ease of storage and access, the texels are divided into even and
odd texels and the odd texels are unfolded to form a rectangular image
as shown below.  The main differences between the triangle and quad textures are:
- The resolutions must be symmetric powers of two.  I.e. the images must be square.
- The adjacency data is identical to the quad case, but the adjacent face and edge values
   for the fourth edge of each face are ignored.
- Subfaces are not supported.  (Non-quad faces in a quad mesh to be
  mapped with quad subfaces, but this is unnecessary with a triangle
  mesh.)
