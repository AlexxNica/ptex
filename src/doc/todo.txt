/**
\page todo To-do list

In work:

Planned:
- large (> 1.0) filter width using "negative" mipmap levels
- user-supplied mipmaps (including negative levels)

Considering:
- elliptical filtering for rectangular textures
- lerp for bilinear and box
- lerp for elliptical filters
- other kernels for elliptical filters (bspline, box, etc.)
- PtexWriter API convenience changes
- big-endian support

Recently done:
- individually stored large meta-data
- clamp/black/periodic boundary modes
- triangle filter support (w/ triangular textures)
- large filter (0.25 to 1.0)
- improved blur quality near EVs
- multi-split on subfaces (for kernel width > 0.5)
- lerp (except for bilinear and box)
- gaussian filter
- bilinear filter
- support non-quads via quad subfaces
- automated regression test
- 'const neighborhood' flag generation in PtexWriter
- new utils: subdivideobj, subdivideptx, unsubdivideptx, objtorib
- switch cachelock to spinlock
- windows port
- namespace for api version encapsulation
