/**
\page todo To-do list

In work:
- individually stored large meta-data
- PtexWriter API convenience changes

Planned:
- user-supplied mipmaps
- lerp for bilinear and box
- lerp for triangular textures
- other kernels for triangular textures (bspline, box, etc.)

Considering:
- large (> 1.0) filter width using face blending
- elliptical filtering for rectangular textures
- multi-level cache
- big-endian

Recently done:
- clamp/black/periodic modes
- triangle filter support (w/ triangular textures)
- large filter (0.25 to 1.0)
- improved blur quality near EVs
- multi-split on subfaces (for kernel width > 0.5)
- lerp (except for bilinear and box)
- gaussian filter
- bilinear filter
- support non-quads via quad subfaces
- automated regression test
- 'const neighborhood' flag generation in PtexWriter
- new utils: subdivideobj, subdivideptx, unsubdivideptx, objtorib
- switch cachelock to spinlock
- windows port
- namespace for api version encapsulation
