/**
\page todo To-do list

In work:
- API rework to support PRMan integration
- individually stored large meta-data
- clamp/black/periodic modes
- triangle mesh support (w/ triangular textures)

Planned:
- user mipmaps
- lerp for bilinear and box

Considering:
- large (> 1.0) filter width using face blending
- multi-level cache
- big-endian?

Recently done:
- large filter (0.25 to 1.0)
- improved blur quality near EVs
- multi-split on subfaces (for kernel width > 0.5)
- lerp (all except bilinear and box)
- gaussian filter
- bilinear filter
- support non-quads via quad subfaces
- automated regression test
- 'const neighborhood' flag generation in PtexWriter
- new utils: subdivideobj, subdivideptx, unsubdivideptx, objtorib
- switch cachelock to spinlock
- windows port
- namespace for api version encapsulation
